# Useful-tools-and-software-for-high-precision-positioning-of-low-cost-smart-devices

Here, we will share some datasets and scripting tools related to high-precision GNSS positioning, integrated navigation, and indoor positioning to reduce obstacles for interested researchers working with this data. These studies focus on smartphones, wearables and autonomous driving. The BUAA RINEX Logger, developed by Professor Shi Chuang's team at Beihang University, is a software that supports the acquisition and recording of GNSS observations across the constellation and at all frequencies. The BUAA RINEX Logger supports the latest quad-band smartphone data logging and is compatible with Android 8.0 and above. The current support for recording data frequency is as follows:

Inaccurate urban positioning has been an ongoing problem with satellite navigation, prompting many attempts at solutions and revealing deep-rooted difficulties. Using an accurate 3D building model database, asymmetric NLOS propagation is modeled to correct for NLOS pseudo-range errors, thereby reducing the positioning error of the phone by more than 50%. We recommend that researchers consider using the 3D city model in the future, and here is an experimental case to demonstrate the powerful advantages of 3DMA:

As we refine the tools, we will continue to upload more useful processing scripts, datasets, and software to the GITHUB repository. We hope that our work can provide some references for relevant interested researchers in pedestrian navigation, indoor and outdoor seamless positioning, and integrated navigation.
